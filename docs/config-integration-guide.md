# Configuration Flow

## Startup Flow

1. When the application starts, it checks if the required executables are configured and valid.
2. If not, it shows a configuration dialog.
3. The user either:
   - Configures the executables, or
   - Exits the application.
4. If configuration is successful, the application continues with normal startup.

## Runtime Flow

If a download operation fails due to missing executables, the system:

- Shows an error dialog.
- Prompts the user to configure the missing executables.
- Retries the operation after successful configuration.

# Testing

## Test with No Configuration

**Expected:** Dialog appears on startup  
- Configure executables → Application starts  
- Cancel → Application exits

## Test with Valid Configuration

**Expected:** Application starts normally without dialog

## Test with Invalid Configuration

**Expected:** Dialog appears with error messages  
- Fix configuration → Application starts  
- Cancel → Application exits

## Test Runtime Detection

- Delete or move a configured executable
- Start a download operation  
**Expected:** Error dialog appears  
- Configure correct path → Download succeeds

---

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

- **Dialog never closes:** Check if the validation is failing silently.
- **Application crashes after configuration:** Verify the executable paths are correctly passed to the services.
- **Configuration not saved:** Check file permissions in the user data directory.

## Debugging

- Use the Electron DevTools to debug the configuration dialog.
- Check the application logs for validation errors.
- Verify environment variables are correctly set and propagated.

# Future Improvements

- Add a dedicated settings page for executable configuration.
- Implement auto-download for missing executables.
- Add version checking for installed executables.
- Add telemetry for configuration success rates.

# Conclusion

This configuration system ensures that Clippy can locate the required executables before attempting to use them, providing a better user experience and preventing cryptic error messages.
